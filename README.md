Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that wants to modernize their operations by implementing more secure algorithms.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I think that I performed the vulnerability checks pretty well. It is important to code securely because vulnerabilites can compromise data integrity. This is especially important if there is customer data at stake. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I found diagnosing each vulnerability pretty challenging because it is a very tedious process and in order to understand each vulnerabiltiy, you need to read up and do research on them. 

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
In order to increase security, I found ways to fix the vulnerabilities. Once you are able to locate and diagnose the vulnerabilities, you are able to determine the best route of action and ultimately neutralize the vulnerability.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured that the code was secure by checking the code for vulnerabilities. It is important to check the code after refactoring because by refactoring, you may have introduced vulnerabilities. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I think that Maven dependency check is a very valuable resource for determining vulnerabilities. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would use this assignment to showcase to an employer because it shows that I have proficiency with using vulnerability checkers.
