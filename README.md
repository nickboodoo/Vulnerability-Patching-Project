This is a repository for a class. 

Artemis Financial is a fictional consulting company that wants to modernize their operations by implementing more secure algorithms. I used the Maven dependency checker to help me with finding vulnerabilities in their code. I found diagnosing each vulnerability pretty challenging because it is a very tedious process and in order to understand each vulnerabiltiy, you need to read up and do research on them. In order to increase security, I found ways to fix the vulnerabilities. Once you are able to locate and diagnose the vulnerabilities, you are able to determine the best route of action and ultimately neutralize the vulnerability. I ensured that the code was secure by checking the code for vulnerabilities. It is important to check the code after refactoring because by refactoring, you may have introduced vulnerabilities. I think that Maven dependency check is a very valuable resource for determining vulnerabilities.
